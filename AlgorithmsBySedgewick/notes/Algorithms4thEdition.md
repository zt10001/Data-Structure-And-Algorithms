# FUNDAMENTALS

*Algorithms* - methods for solving problems that are suited for computer implementation.

Algorithms go hand in hand with *data structures* - schemes for organizing data that leave them amenable to efficient processing by an algorithm.

This chapter introduces the basic tools that we need to study algorithms and data structures.

## BASIC PROGRAMMING MODEL

We refer to the programming constructs, software libraries, and operating system features that we use to implement and describe algorithms as our *programming model*.
