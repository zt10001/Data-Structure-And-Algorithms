You are probably wondering why we did not provide you with the 5th out of 17 test datasets that brought down your program. The reason is that nobody will provide you with the test cases in real life!

When you are confident that your program works, you often test it on
just a few test cases, and if the answers look reasonable, you consider your
work done. However, this is a recipe for a disaster. To make your program
always work, you should test it on a set of carefully designed test cases.
Learning how to implement algorithms as well as test and debug your
programs will be invaluable in your future work as a programmer.
