3. Which tests should you perform before submitting a solution to the programming assignment?

Test on the examples from the problem statement. Then make a few other small tests, solve them manually and check that your program outputs the correct answer. Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn't consume too much memory. Test for corner cases: smallest allowed values and largest allowed values of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings, etc. Then make a stress test. After all these tests passed, submit the solution.
